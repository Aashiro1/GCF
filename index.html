          <p class="paragraph-content">
            Great compassion is like the sky, because it covers all living
            beings; great compassion is like the earth, because it produces all
            the teachings; great compassion makes it possible to see buddha
            nature, by first clarifying real knowledge for the sake of others.
          </p>
          <p class="paragraph-content extra">
            Great compassion makes it possible to pass through unyielding
            barriers, by plumbing the profound teachings more and more for the
            sake of others. Great compassion makes it possible to pass through
            unyielding barriers, by plumbing the profound teachings more and
            more for the sake of others. Great compassion makes it possible to
            pass through unyielding barriers, by plumbing the profound teachings
            more and more for the sake of others. Great compassion makes it
            possible to penetrate the transcendental, by seeking a life beyond
            for others. Great compassion can develop powerful application, by
            striving on this path for the sake of others. Great compassion can
            activate intrepidness, by keeping a vigorous will alive for the sake
            of others. Great compassion makes it possible to get beyond
            regression, because the mind is settled for the sake of others.
            Great compassion can produce broad learning, by studying everything
            for the sake of others. Great compassion can produce erudition, by
            deep deduction of the principles of things for the sake of others.
            Great compassion can produce blessings, by always coming up with
            expedients for others. Great compassion can annihilate afflictions,
            by sacrificing body, life, and goods for others. Great compassion
            can extirpate conceit, by acting benevolently for others. Great
            compassion enables detachment from fame and profit, by basing
            everything on truth for the sake of others. Great compassion enables
            entry into the realm of reality, because there is nowhere it does
            not go for the sake of others. The virtues of great compassion are
            infinite; they could be expounded upon forever without exhausting
            them, but it boils down to this: Whoever has great compassion can
            extinguish all obstructions caused by past actions and can fulfill
            all virtues; no principle cannot be understood, no path cannot be
            practiced, no knowledge not attained, no virtue not developed. Just
            as when you want to win people’s hearts you first love their
            children, the Buddhas and bodhisattvas consider all living beings
            their children, so if you love all living beings equally, all the
            Buddhas will be moved to respond.

            We are delighted to announce the relaunch of the Great Compassion
            Fund, dedicated to assisting those in need in Nepal, India, and Sri
            Lanka.
          </p>
          <p class="paragraph-content extra">
            This initiative was originally established during the 2015
            earthquake in Nepal, and we are now committed to extending our
            support to people in South Asia. My father, Late Min Bahadur Shakya
            expressed his desire to carry out charitable endeavors under this
            name. In memory of our beloved father, we seek to pay tribute to him
            by continuing his noble aspirations. We invite all his students, and
            anyone interested to join us in preserving his legacy through
            supporting his philanthropic projects, such as the Nun Education
            Project and the Great Compassion Fund. Below, you can find a summary
            of some of our completed activities thus far. Together, let's keep
            his dream alive and make a meaningful impact on the lives of those
            in need.
