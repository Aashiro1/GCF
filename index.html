    <p class="paragraph-content">
      Great compassion is like the sky, because it covers all living beings;
      great compassion is like the earth, because it produces all the
      teachings; great compassion makes it possible to see buddha nature, by
      first clarifying real knowledge for the sake of others.


      <p class="paragraph-content extra">
        Great
      compassion makes it possible to pass through unyielding barriers, by
      plumbing the profound teachings more and more for the sake of others.

        Great
      compassion makes it possible to pass through unyielding barriers, by
      plumbing the profound teachings more and more for the sake of others.
        Great compassion makes it possible to penetrate the transcendental, by
    seeking a life beyond for others.
        Great compassion can develop
        powerful application, by striving on this path for the sake of others.

        Great compassion can activate intrepidness, by keeping a vigorous will
        alive for the sake of others. Great compassion makes it possible to
        get beyond regression, because the mind is settled for the sake of
        others. Great compassion can produce broad learning, by studying
        everything for the sake of others. Great compassion can produce
        erudition, by deep deduction of the principles of things for the sake
        of others. Great compassion can produce blessings, by always coming up
        with expedients for others. Great compassion can annihilate
        afflictions, by sacrificing body, life, and goods for others. Great
        compassion can extirpate conceit, by acting benevolently for others.
        Great compassion enables detachment from fame and profit, by basing
        everything on truth for the sake of others. Great compassion enables
        entry into the realm of reality, because there is nowhere it does not
        go for the sake of others. The virtues of great compassion are
        infinite; they could be expounded upon forever without exhausting
        them, but it boils down to this: Whoever has great compassion can
        extinguish all obstructions caused by past actions and can fulfill all
        virtues; no principle cannot be understood, no path cannot be
        practiced, no knowledge not attained, no virtue not developed. Just as
        when you want to win people’s hearts you first love their children,
        the Buddhas and bodhisattvas consider all living beings their
        children, so if you love all living beings equally, all the Buddhas
        will be moved to respond.

    <p class="paragraph-content">
      We are delighted to announce the relaunch of the Great Compassion Fund, dedicated to assisting those in need in Nepal, India, and Sri Lanka.
      <p class="paragraph-content extra">
        This initiative was originally established during the 2015 earthquake in Nepal, and we are now committed to extending our support to people in South Asia.
        My father, Late Min Bahadur Shakya expressed his desire to carry out charitable endeavors under this name.
        In memory of our beloved father, we seek to pay tribute to him by continuing his noble aspirations.
        We invite all his students, and anyone interested to join us in preserving his legacy through supporting his philanthropic projects, such as the Nun Education Project and the Great Compassion Fund. Below, you can find a summary of some of our completed activities thus far. Together, let's keep his dream alive and make a meaningful impact on the lives of those in need.
